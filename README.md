Task 3:Use the data set of employee information and build a model that can predict which employees are most likely to leave the company

Data Collection:
Gather a comprehensive dataset of employee information. 
Demographic details (age, gender, marital status, etc.)
Job-related attributes (job role, department, salary, years at the company, etc.)
Performance metrics (performance ratings, number of projects, etc.)
Other relevant factors (training hours, work-life balance, satisfaction level, etc.)
The target variable (whether the employee left the company: yes/no)

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.

Feature Engineering: Create new features from existing ones if necessary, such as tenure buckets, or interaction terms.

Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert categorical variables into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

Normalization/Standardization: Scale numerical features to ensure they contribute equally to the model.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):Visualize and analyze the data to understand patterns, distributions, and relationships between features.
Identify correlations between features and the target variable.

Model Building:Split the data into training and testing sets.
Choose appropriate models for the task. Common models for classification include Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Train the models on the training dataset.
